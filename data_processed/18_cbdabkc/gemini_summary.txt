**Clinical Summary**

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-grade myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with excess blasts is the primary differential diagnosis, indicated by circulating myeloblasts, erythroblasts, and basophilia. **The most important next step is immediate bone marrow biopsy and aspiration with flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and FISH for definitive diagnosis and prognostication.**
